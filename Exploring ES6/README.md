# Exploring ES6

This project includes various JavaScript examples to demonstrate different language features and concepts.

## Features

1. **Self-Invoking Function**
   - Calculates and alerts the sum of two numbers.

2. **Iteration Methods**
   - Demonstrates `for...in`, `for...of`, and `.forEach()` for iterating over arrays.

3. **Spread Operator**
   - Uses the spread operator to create a new array by combining existing arrays.

4. **Student Class**
   - Defines a `Student` class with properties and a method to print student data.

## Concepts Learned

- **Self-Invoking Functions**: How to create and use immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE).
- **Iteration Techniques**: The differences between `for...in`, `for...of`, and `.forEach()` for looping through arrays.
- **Spread Operator**: How to use the spread operator to merge arrays.
- **Classes in JavaScript**: How to define a class, create objects, and use template literals to print data.
