# Simple Portoflio

## Description

This project is part of the ITI Internship 2024, where I applied the knowledge I gained throughout the internship to create a web application using **React** and **Bootstrap**. The app is designed to be a personal portfolio that displays various sections including **About**, **Skills**, **Projects**, **Dreams**, and **Contact Information**.

## Features

- **Component-based Structure**: Built with React, the app is divided into reusable components like `Nav`, `About`, `Projects`, `Skills`, and `Contact`, making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: Implemented smooth scrolling for seamless navigation between sections, improving the user experience when navigating through the page.
- **Responsive Layout**: Using Bootstrap's grid system and utilities, the application is fully responsive across all screen sizes.
- **Project Sections**: Detailed sections that showcase various projects I've worked on, each with a description and external links to the project.
- **Skills Section**: Displays the list of skills I have learned during my internship and previous work experience.
- **Dreams Section**: A personal section where I share my future goals and aspirations.
- **Contact Information**: A section dedicated to how people can contact me, including email and social media links.
- **Modern UI/UX Design**: The app is designed to provide a modern, sleek, and user-friendly interface with a clean and minimalist look.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web applications.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and layout design, including the sticky navbar and smooth scrolling functionality.
