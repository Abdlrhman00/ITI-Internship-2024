# Today's tips

This project demonstrates how to display tips either by looping through them All at once or showing them automatically at regular intervals. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve these functionalities.

## Features

1. **Manual Display**: Click the "Display All Tips" button to loop through and display all tips.
2. **Automatic Display**: Click the "Display Tips Automatically" button to show tips every 3 seconds.

## Concepts Learned

- **Generators**: Utilized JavaScript generators to iterate over an array of tips.
- **Event Listeners**: Implemented event listeners to handle button clicks for both manual and automatic tip displays.
- **Intervals**: Used `setInterval` to display tips at regular intervals.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updated the content of the DOM elements dynamically.
