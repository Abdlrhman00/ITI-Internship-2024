# Task 2 - To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and filter them based on their status (to-do or finished).

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Task**: Tasks can be edited to update their content.
- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be deleted from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to view only to-do tasks, finished tasks, or all tasks.

## Concepts Learned

- **DOM Manipulation**: The project demonstrates how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically add, edit, and remove HTML elements based on user interactions.
  
- **Event Handling**: Event listeners are used to capture user interactions such as clicking buttons and selecting dropdown options.
